        <h1>Java 1: OOP</h1>
        <p class="lead">
					<i>Idiomatic OOPs...</i><br>
				</p>
      </div>
			
			<div class="tutorial-text">
        Now the fun begins...<br>
				<br>
				Let's go back to our idea of classes. A class is a collection of variables and methods.<br>
				The strength of OOP lies in the ability to reuse code, extend code, and organize.<br>
				We'll define a <code>Particle</code> and we're going to represent the universe with this structure.<br>
				We'll use a large and intricate system to define the physical laws of this world.<br>
				
<pre>
class Particle {
	int type;
	
	Particle(int t) {
		type = t;
	}
}
</pre>

				Each object created either by the Java community or you, automatically extends Object.<br>
				An Object already has methods defined that all classes inherit. That means that any Object<br>
				will contain these methods: either the default ones created by Java, or the new ones you define.<br>
				Let's quickly define some methods for particle to particle interaction.<br>
			
<pre>
class Particle {
	static int numberAllTypes = 16;
	int type;
	
	Particle(int t) {
		type = t;
	}
	
	String toString() {
		return type + "";
	}
	
	Particle collide(Particle other) {
		return new Particle((type + other.type) % numberAllTypes);
	}
}
</pre>			
	
				Note that we created a new method <code>Particle collide(Particle other)</code> and extended<br>
				a method from Object named toString(), which is the string representation of this class.<br>
				<br>
				Here we're going to introduce the idea of "is-a" relationship. Particularly, we want to group<br>
				all particles under a base class <code>Particle</code>. Also, this has to be balanced with some<br>
				guarantee of what is a <code>Particle</code>. Otherwise, we could just group everything under<br>
				Object, and we would have no idea what is and isn't a particle.<br>
				<br>
				The idea of a "guarantee" is simply that Particle and any classes that extend it follow these rules:<br>
				they can all be treated as instances of type <code>Particle</code> â€” each instance "is-a" <code>Particle</code>;<br>
				and they are known to have defined or inherited the methods contained within <code>Particle</code>. 
				We must either inherit or override class members and keep the same <b>signature</b>,<br>
				meaning that if we use the inherited name (and arguments), then we must keep the same type.<br>
				<br>
				Now let's extend the class <code>Particle</code>. We're creating a new subclass<br>
				and we'll call it <code>ElementaryParticle</code>. Since we're guaranteeing that <code>ElementaryParticle</code><br>
				can be treated like a Particle, it must also invoke a constructor of Particle. The exact process<br>
				is that each <code>ElementaryParticle</code> created first creates an instance of <code>Particle</code>.<br>
				<br>
				We'll introduce the keyword <code>super</code>, which is used to access a superclass's methods (and constructors).<br>
				
<pre>
class ElementaryParticle extends Particle {
	double charge;
	double spin;
	
	ElementaryParticle(int type) {
		super(type);
		charge = (type / 4) / (double) 4 - 0.5;
		spin = (double) type / (double) numberAllTypes;
	}
	
	//Let's add custom behavior for elementary particles
	Particle collide(Particle other) {
		Paricle base = super.collide(other);
		base.type += (type + other.type) / 2;
		return base;
	}
}
</pre>				
				
				Let's try to define custom behavior for ElementaryParticle collision. We would at first try<br> 
				<code>ElementaryParticle collide(ElementaryParticle other)</code>, but we have a problem here.<br>
				All instances of <code>ElementaryParticle</code> are <code>Particle</code>, so which method would be called?<br>
				We'll use the method we defined and introduce the <code>instanceof</code> keyword. 
				
<pre>
class ElementaryParticle extends Particle {
	double charge;
	double spin;
	
	ElementaryParticle(int type) {
		super(type);
		charge = (type / 4) / (double) 4 - 0.5;
		spin = (double) type / (double) numberAllTypes;
	}
	
	ElementaryParticle(int type, double c, double s) {
		super(type);
		charge = c;
		spin = s;
	}
	
	//Let's add custom behavior for elementary particles
	Particle collide(Particle other) {
		if (other instanceof ElementaryParticle) {
			ElementaryParticle otherCasted = (ElementaryParticle) other;
			ElementaryParticle elem = new ElementaryParticle((type + other.type) / 2);
			elem.charge = charge * otherCasted.charge;
			elem.spin = spin / (spin + otherCasted.spin);
			return elem;
		}
		else {
			Paricle base = super.collide(other);
			base.type += (type + other.type) / 2;
			return base;
		}
	}
}

Particle[] particles = {new Particle(8), new ElementaryParticle(2)};
Particle third = particles[0].collide(particles[1]);
</pre>					
				
				Let's make our first data structure and introduce the "has-a" relationship.<br>
				An alternative method of extension to include an instance of the super class within the sub class.<br>
				
<pre>
class Collection {
	Particle particle;
	Particle[] childParticles;
	Collection(Particle p, Particle[] c) {
		particle = p;
		childParticles = c;
	}
}
</pre>
				
				We learned how to extend code. What if we want to group code?<br>
				The problem is that we have a class <code>Spark</code> that is definitely not a <code>Particle</code><br>
				but shares a <code>void show(obj)</code> method with it. We use interfaces to passively group classes together.<br>
				An interface is a class declaration of usually only methods with no body. There is no default behavior.<br>
				
<pre>
interface Graphic {
	void show();
	Graphic join(Graphic g);
}
</pre>

				Now we say that Particle and Spark must implement the interface Graphic. These two classes<br>
				must implement, in their own way, the methods prototyped in Graphic.<br>
				
<pre>
class Particle implements Graphic {
	static int numberAllTypes = 16;
	int type;
	
	/* other methods and constructors not shown */
	
	void show() { 
		System.out.println(type);
	}
	
	Particle join(Particle g) { //Note in place of Graphic g, we used Particle g.
		return new Particle(type + g.type);
	}
}

class Spark implements Graphic {
	/* other methods and constructors not shown */
	
	Spark(int n) {
		/* implementation not shown */
	}
	
	void show() { 
		/* implementation not shown */
	}
	
	Spark join(Spark g) { 
		/* implementation not shown */
	}
}

Graphic[] array = new Graphic[3];
array[0] = new Particle(8); array[1] = new ElementaryParticle(2,-0.3,0.75); 
array[2] = new Spark(5);
array[3] = array[0].join(array[1]).join(array[2]);
</pre>
	
				Now we have a real conumdrum. What if we want an object to have two superclasses?<br>
				Let's look at the following situation: we want to group particles by colors.<br>
				
<pre>
class RedObject {
	/* implementation not shown */
	void showRed() {
		/* ... */
	}
}
class GreenObject {
	/* ... */
	void showGreen() {
		/* ... */
	}
}
class BlueObject {
	/* ... */
	void showBlue() {
		/* ... */
	}
}
</pre>
				
				This works fine if we have distinct red, green, and blue objects. Then we define, as before,<br>

<pre>
class RedHerring extends RedObject() {
	void showRed() {
		/* implementation not shown */
	}
}
</pre>
				
				Let's say we have a cyan herring, which is both blue and green. Before we get into the code,<br>
				let's resolve what a cyan herring does. We have two possible solutions:<br>
				a cyan herring shows blue and shows green at the same time;<br>
				or, it defines a new behavior, such as showing cyan.<br>
				
				We'll look at both to see how the approach changes. Let's go for the first one.<br>
				Java does not allow multiple inheritance (can you guess why this is the case?).<br>
				However, we can still have multiple "guarantees" through multiple interfaces.<br>
				
<pre>
//Remember, interfaces normally do not have methods with bodies.
//However, we can define static behavior, and default behavior. More on that later.
interface GreenObject { 
	void showGreen();
}
interface BlueObject {
	void showBlue();
}
class BlueSnapper implements BlueObject {
	void showBlue() {
		System.out.println("Blue herring")
	}
}
class CyanHerring implements GreenObject implements BlueObject {
	void showGreen() {
		System.out.println("The green side of a cyan herring");
	}
	void showBlue() {
		System.out.println("The blue side of a cyan herring");
	}
}

Object[] possiblyAnything = new Object[3];
possiblyAnything[0] = ElementaryParticle(5);
</pre>
				
				Note that the interfaces approach is much more logical for this problem since<br>
				all green objects do not "evolve" from one common ancestor; rather, they are meant to be grouped<br>
				by their common trait. A green car and a blue car have much more in common,<br>
				than a blue car and a blue fish.<br>
